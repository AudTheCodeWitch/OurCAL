>  OurCal is a community-generated Crochet-Along (CAL). Anyone can design a
          block using the graphghan generator and submit it to our database. Users
          can then view one another's blocks and implement their favorites in a
          one-of-a-kind blanket!

## Usage
OurCAL runs on PostgreSQL. To start your PostgreSQL server, run: 
```sh

```

`cd` into `./backend/our-cal-api` and seed the database:
```shell script
rails db:seed
``` 
 Start the backend server by running:
```shell script
rails s
```

`cd` into `./frontend` and start the frontend server by running:
```shell script
npx reload-b
```

## 🤝 Contributing
Before we deploy OurCal, there are a few more odds and ends to tie up:
* Add user sessions
* Add the ability to edit one's submitted patterns
* Add the ability to view patterns by designer
          
After initial deployment, we'll add some additional features:
* View other's patterns in your color scheme
* Arrange selected blocks on a blanket template
* Generate written instructions for patterns
* Add a print-friendly view of patterns with instructions
